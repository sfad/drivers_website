# Privacy Policy — Draft Data Map

This is a draft data map and checklist for the privacy policy; not the final policy text. Per your instructions, this is a pre-draft artifact for review.

## Data flows (static website)
- Analytics: Google Analytics or similar (collects IP, device, pageviews)
- Cookies: session cookies for preferences (theme, language)
- Contact form: email address, message contents (if implemented later)
- Icons/Assets: images served from repo or CDN (no PII)
- Location demo (optional): mock GPS prompting (not collected) — if implemented, must be declared

## Third parties (examples)
- Google Analytics — link to privacy policy
- CDN or hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Netlify) — link to provider privacy
- Fonts provider (Google Fonts) — link to policy

## Checklist items to include in policy
- Data collected
- Purpose
- Third parties
- Retention
- Security
- Children & parental consent
- User rights & contact
- Effective date & changelog

> After you review this draft data map I will prepare a full privacy policy file that follows Apple/Google store guidance.
